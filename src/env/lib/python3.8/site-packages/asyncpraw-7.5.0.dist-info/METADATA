Async PRAW, an abbreviation for "Asynchronous Python Reddit API Wrapper", is a Python
package that allows for simple access to Reddit's API. Async PRAW aims to be easy to use
and internally follows all of `Reddit's API rules
<https://github.com/reddit/reddit/wiki/API>`_. With Async PRAW there's no need to
introduce ``sleep`` calls in your code. Give your client an appropriate user agent and
you're set.

.. _installation:

Installation
------------

Async PRAW is supported on Python 3.6+. The recommended way to install Async PRAW is via
`pip <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip>`_.

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install asyncpraw

To install the latest development version of Async PRAW run the following instead:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install --upgrade https://github.com/praw-dev/asyncpraw/archive/master.zip

For instructions on installing Python and pip see "The Hitchhiker's Guide to Python"
`Installation Guides <https://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/starting/installation/>`_.

Quickstart
----------

Assuming you already have a credentials for a script-type OAuth application you can
instantiate an instance of Async PRAW like so:

.. code-block:: python

    import asyncpraw

    reddit = asyncpraw.Reddit(
        client_id="CLIENT_ID",
        client_secret="CLIENT_SECRET",
        password="PASSWORD",
        user_agent="USERAGENT",
        username="USERNAME",
    )

With the ``reddit`` instance you can then interact with Reddit:

.. code-block:: python

    # Create a submission to r/test
    subreddit = await reddit.subreddit("test")
    await subreddit.submit("Test Submission", url="https://reddit.com")

    # Comment on a known submission
    submission = await reddit.submission(
        url="https://www.reddit.com/comments/5e1az9", fetch=False
    )
    await submission.reply("Super rad!")

    # Reply to the first comment of a weekly top thread of a moderated community
    subreddit = await reddit.subreddit("mod")
    async for submission in subreddit.top("week"):
        comments = await submission.comments()
        await comments[0].reply("An automated reply")

    # Output score for the first 256 items on the frontpage
    async for submission in reddit.front.hot(limit=256):
        print(submission.score)

    # Obtain the moderator listing for r/redditdev
    subreddit = await reddit.subreddit("redditdev")
    async for moderator in subreddit.moderator:
        print(moderator)

Please see Async PRAW's `documentation <https://asyncpraw.readthedocs.io/>`_ for more
examples of what you can do with Async PRAW.

Async PRAW Discussion and Support
